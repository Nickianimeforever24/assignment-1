    <h1> Donation For Covid-19 Cure </h1> 

    <p> Why you should Donate? </p>

    <p> Covid-19 has reached 9 million and continues to grow everyday. Scientists push forward with efforts to develop a cure. "People are looking into whether existing antivirals might work or whether new drugs could be developed to try to tackle the virus" said Dr. Bruce Y. Lee, a Cuny Graduate professor. But the fundings are at an all time high. Our scientists have been working diligently for months for a break through. Researching can take plenty of time and with limited resources, we won't have enough for everyone. Please fight for a Covid-19 cure. </p>
